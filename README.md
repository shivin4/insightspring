# InsightSpring

InsightSpring is a read-only analytics platform designed to analyze publicly available Reddit discussions and surface recurring problem statements, unmet needs, and emerging trends.

The goal of InsightSpring is to help developers, entrepreneurs, and product teams discover real-world problems worth solving by learning from large-scale community conversations.

## What InsightSpring Does
- Collects public posts and comments from selected subreddits using the Reddit API
- Analyzes discussion content to identify common pain points and themes
- Aggregates insights at a high level without republishing or modifying content
- Links back to original Reddit posts for attribution and transparency

## What InsightSpring Does NOT Do
- Post or comment on Reddit
- Message or interact with users
- Access private, deleted, or restricted content
- Circumvent Reddit rate limits or platform policies

## Intended Use
InsightSpring is intended for research and analytical purposes only. All data processing is performed off-platform, and results are presented as summarized insights rather than raw content.

## Status
This project is currently in early development.
